# :wave: Hello, we are Abyss

We are an early college startup on a mission to create Abyss‒the IDE for 3D that
is friendly, fun, and lowers the barrier of entry to making 3D content.

We are boarding new members, and running a side project called **Bookish**‒a
platform for raising funds for accessing books. This project is to give everyone
a chance to familiarize with the modern developer stack.

If you are interested in joining us, please fill out this [**Early Member Intake
form**][form]! Abyss Inc. is a remote-first, work-hard-play-hard team.

Thank you for reading! :heart:
