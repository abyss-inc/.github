# :wave: Hello, we are Abyss Inc.

We believe in several things:
1. **Web browsers are increasingly capable of serious applications.** The idea
   that the Web is a place only for simple GIF-laden HTML documents and ReactJS
   e-commerce sites won't cling for much longer. From Figma to Microsoft 365,
   people are starting to realize how simple it is to just open a link in a web
   browser and start getting work done. With the advent of technologies such as
   WebAssembly, WebGPU, WebNN, and other Web-goodies, websites are getting more
   capable than ever.
2. **The future of content is 3D.** Video games, simulations, the Metaverseâ€¦3D
   graphics is a cornerstone of entertainment, and will soon be a cornerstone of
   our entire digital experience. It is crucial that this 3D-based experience
   is accessible to everyone.

We position ourselves at the intersection of the Web and 3D graphics, and we are
on a mission to build the infrastructure that brings 3D to everyone in the Web
and metaverse era using Web technologies.

Abyss Inc. was founded by [Zach](https://github.com/cszach). We are
